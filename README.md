Many job seekers struggle to find job opportunities suited to their skills. Existing job platforms are not tailored to small businesses or gig work, making it harder for some workers to connect with employers. Our solution is this:

A job-matching platform that helps job seekers find local gigs and full-time positions. Employers can post jobs, and users can create profiles to match with relevant openings.
